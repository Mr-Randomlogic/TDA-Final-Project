My final project for The Developer Academy bootcamp.
This folder contains 3 Jupyter Notebooks:
  1. Final Furniture - This notebook contains my initial exploratory data analysis of the data overall before going into the Furniture category and subcategories.
  2. Final Office - This notebook constains my data analysis for the Furniture category and it's subcategories.
  3. Final Technology - This notebook contains data analysis for the Technology category and it's subcategories.
  4. Final Project(ions) - In this notebook I fit the data into a model, measure accuracy, make some basic prediction as well as save the .plk file needed for Streamlit.
  5. Superstore.csv - The Original dataset.
  6.  gb_model.pkl - The .pkl file needed to run the streamlit app.
  7.  Superstore_app.py - The Python file needed to run the Streamlit app.
